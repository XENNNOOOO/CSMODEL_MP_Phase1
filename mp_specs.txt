6.1 Phase 1
The following steps must be accomplished for the first phase of the project. Note that these steps do not have to be done
strictly in a sequential order.

6.1.1 Dataset Description
Each group will work on a real-world dataset. Follow your instructor’s directives on what dataset you will be working on. If
your instructor lets you choose your own dataset, make sure that you have their approval, and that the dataset you choose
is obtained ethically and legally, in accordance with data privacy laws.
The group must familiarize themselves with their dataset. This includes not only knowing the attributes of the dataset, but
also understanding how it was collected, recognizing the possible biases and implications of the sampling method, and other
factors that are relevant to the potential insights that could be generated from the data. Note that you may need to look at
other related sources for this part of the project.

In the Notebook, the following information should be stated in a concise manner:
    • A clear, concise description of the dataset
    • How the dataset was collected
    • Potential implications of how the data was collected on the insights that will be generated


• Struture of the data
    – What each row and column represents (if tabular data)
    – Number of observations
    – What attributes or features are present in each observation

• Brief description of the different attributes in the dataset (if structured), or brief description of the nature of each
observation in the data (if unstructured)

6.2 Data Cleaning
Ensure the integrity of the dataset by applying the relevant cleaning steps. For tabular data, this might entail addressing
the following:

    • Multiple representations of the same categorical value
    • Incorrect datatypes
    • Missing data
    • Duplicate data
    • Inconsistent formatting
    • Outliers

For unstructured data, you must check for potentially noise or unwanted data, or apply a modelling scheme to convert them
first into a tabular format.

In the Notebook, explain all the procedures applied during the data cleaning process.

6.2.1 Research Question & Exploratory Data Analysis
You must come up with a general research question that you want to explore using the dataset that you have.
For CSMODEL, please abide by the following guidelines when coming up with the research question:
    • The question does not necessarily have to be groundbreaking, but it must be something that the group is genuinely
    interested in.
    • The question should not be too specific (i.e., focused only on a few variables); it should be something that warrants
    an extensive exploration of the dataset. For example, instead of “Is the average sleep duration correlated with poor
    academic performance?”, consider “What are the factors associated with poor academic performance?” If your question
    is too specific, you will have difficulty fulfilling the minimum requirements for the project.
    • The question should be feasible to answer given the dataset/s that you have (obviously).

The identification of the research question goes hand-in-hand with the exploratory data analysis (EDA). Sometimes, the
EDA can lead you to interesting research questions. On the other hand, sometimes you have an initial research question,
which is then refined or confirmed by the EDA. In this project, you don’t have to strictly do one before the other. You must
iterate between the EDA and question formulation until you come up with a solid angle that is supported by the data.

The whole process must cover at least three (3) exploratory data analysis questions. Explicitly state the questions in
the Notebook. Having more than 3 questions is acceptable, especially if 3 questions are not enough to get a sufficient
understanding of your data.

Answer each EDA question using appropriate numerical summaries (measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion,
correlation) and visualizations (histograms, distribution plots, box plots)
