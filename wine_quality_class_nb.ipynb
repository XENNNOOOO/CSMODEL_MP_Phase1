    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "This dataset consists of 1,000 wine samples, where each sample has been assessed using four chemical features and assigned a quality label (low, medium, or high). The dataset is intended for classification tasks—the objective is to build a model that can predict the quality_label of a wine based on its chemical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wines can have their quality influenced by various physicochemical factors (e.g., sugar content, acidity, alcohol). Understanding these can help producers and researchers assess wine characteristics and potentially improve production quality."
